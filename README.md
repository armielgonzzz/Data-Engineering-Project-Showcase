# Data Engineering Projects

## Project 1: ETL Pipeline with Pandas and MySQL
In this project, we apply Data modelling with MySQL and build an ETL pipeline using Python. We're give a dataset of the stats of all the teams participating in USA NCAA. We are to build a pipeline that will transform the dataset leaving only the teams that are competing in this year's March Madness. After transforming the dataset, this will be inserted in our database in MySQL.

## Project 2: API Data to MySQL Data Pipeline
In this project, we are to extract data of all the Dota 2 Heroes from a public API. This data will then get transformed after going though the data pipeline. Finally, it will be loaded into the local MySQL Database.

## Project 3: API Data Extaction and Transformation to Azure Blob Storage
In this project, we apply data modelling to the data that is extracted from a public API of NBA Games. This data will be then transformed by the ETL pipeline and then uploaded to a Azure Blob Storage container. The file that is uploaded contains all of the games that we're played today in CSV format.
