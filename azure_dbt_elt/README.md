# Project Idea: Sales Data Pipeline and Dashboard with DBT, Azure, and Power BI

## Overview:
You will build a scalable data pipeline that ingests raw sales data, transforms it using DBT, stores it in Azure Synapse Analytics, and then visualizes the results on a Power BI dashboard. This project will help you understand key data engineering concepts, cloud computing with Azure, data transformations with DBT, and dashboarding with Power BI.

## Architecture:

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer:
- **Tool:** Azure Data Factory (ADF)
- **Process:**
  - Use Azure Data Factory to ingest raw sales data from various sources such as CSV files stored in Azure Blob Storage, SQL databases, or APIs.
  - Schedule the ingestion process using ADF pipelines to load data into a staging area in Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL Data Warehouse).

### 2. Data Storage Layer:
- **Tool:** Azure Synapse Analytics (SQL Pool)
- **Process:**
  - Store raw, unprocessed data in a dedicated staging schema in Azure Synapse Analytics.
  - Create tables to store the transformed data that DBT will generate.

### 3. Data Transformation Layer:
- **Tool:** DBT (Data Build Tool)
- **Process:**
  - Use DBT to manage and automate SQL-based data transformations within Azure Synapse.
  - Write DBT models to clean, aggregate, and transform the sales data (e.g., calculate total sales, average order value, etc.).
  - Implement tests in DBT to ensure data quality and integrity.
  - Use DBT to create materialized views or tables in Azure Synapse, which will serve as the source for your dashboard.

### 4. Data Visualization Layer:
- **Tool:** Power BI
- **Process:**
  - Connect Power BI to Azure Synapse to visualize the transformed data.
  - Create dashboards that provide insights into sales performance, trends, and key metrics.
  - Implement drill-down capabilities, filters, and interactive visualizations to allow users to explore the data.

### 5. Orchestration and Monitoring:
- **Tool:** Azure Data Factory, Azure Monitor
- **Process:**
  - Orchestrate the entire workflow using Azure Data Factory to schedule DBT runs after data ingestion.
  - Monitor pipeline performance, data quality checks, and transformation success/failure using Azure Monitor and logging features in ADF.

## Detailed Workflow:

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Raw sales data is ingested into Azure Blob Storage (for CSV files) or directly into Azure Synapse Analytics using Azure Data Factory.

2. **Data Transformation with DBT:**
   - DBT is set up to connect to Azure Synapse Analytics.
   - You write models that transform the raw sales data into a cleaned and structured format.
   - Transformations include calculating sales metrics, filtering for specific time periods, and joining with other datasets like product or customer information.
   - Run DBT models either manually or automatically via Azure Data Factory.

3. **Dashboarding with Power BI:**
   - Connect Power BI to the transformed tables/views in Azure Synapse Analytics.
   - Build a dashboard that displays sales KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) like total revenue, number of orders, customer acquisition rate, etc.
   - Enable users to filter by date, region, product category, and more.

4. **Orchestration:**
   - Use Azure Data Factory to schedule the entire process, from data ingestion to transformation and dashboard refreshes.
   - Ensure that DBT transformations run after the data ingestion process is complete.
   - Set up alerts in Azure Monitor to notify you of any failures or anomalies in the pipeline.

## Tips and Tricks:

1. **Master SQL:**
   - Strong SQL skills are crucial for working with DBT and databases like Azure Synapse. Focus on advanced SQL topics like window functions, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and joins.

2. **Learn Azure Fundamentals:**
   - Study Azure services like Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Azure Blob Storage. Understand how they integrate with each other in data workflows.

3. **Understand ELT vs. ETL:**
   - DBT is part of the ELT paradigm, where raw data is first loaded into a data warehouse, and then transformations are applied. Contrast this with ETL and understand when to use each.

4. **DBT Best Practices:**
   - Learn how to modularize your DBT models using subdirectories and naming conventions.
   - Implement data tests to ensure data integrity.
   - Use version control (e.g., Git) for your DBT project.

5. **Dashboard Design:**
   - Study best practices for creating effective dashboards. Focus on clarity, simplicity, and making sure the most important metrics are easy to find.

6. **Automation and CI/CD:**
   - Look into automating your DBT runs using CI/CD pipelines with tools like GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps. This ensures that your data transformations are consistent and reliable.

7. **Documentation and Data Governance:**
   - Use DBT's documentation features to generate clear, accessible documentation for your data models. This is crucial for data governance and collaboration.

## What to Study:

1. **SQL:** Advanced querying, performance optimization.
2. **DBT:** Core concepts, Jinja templating, macros, and testing.
3. **Azure Data Services:** Focus on Azure Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, and Blob Storage.
4. **Power BI:** Dashboard design, data modeling, and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
5. **Python (Optional):** For any scripting or custom data processing tasks.
6. **Version Control:** Git for managing DBT projects and collaborative work.

This project will give you hands-on experience across key areas of data engineering and prepare you for real-world challenges in building and maintaining data pipelines.
